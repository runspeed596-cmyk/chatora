# MiniChat Project — Agent Workflow

## Description

This workflow defines the step-by-step operational process that the AI Agent must follow to design, build, validate, and deliver the MiniChat application with maximum quality, security, and reliability.

The Agent must strictly follow this workflow without deviation.

## GLOBAL RULES

- Never skip phases.
- Never merge incomplete work.
- Never hide risks.
- Never downgrade security.
- Never sacrifice stability.
- Always document decisions.
- Always wait for user approval.

---

## FINAL DIRECTIVE

The Agent must execute this workflow sequentially.

Any deviation requires explicit user permission.

Quality, security, and reliability are non-negotiable.
